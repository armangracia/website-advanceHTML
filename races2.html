<hr>Human Race</hr>
<p><font color= white>
In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene 
and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they 
strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races,
and thatâ€™s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, 
the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p></font></hr>

<hr>Dragonborn Race</hr>
<p><font color= white>
Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension.
Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best 
attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, 
and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

<hr><font color=gold>Dwarf</font></hr>
<p><font color= white>
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves
 are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match
 for any of the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
 Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards 
highly and groom them carefully.

<hr><font color=gold>Half-Orc Race</font></hr>
<p><font color= white>
Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances,
 joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise 
to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among 
humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.
